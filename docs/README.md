`de_wiktio` is a Python package to parse and extract data from the *German Wiktionary*. It allows users to access *wikitext* content, either by fetching it directly online or by preprocessing and loading dump files locally for faster access.


This package can be thought of as a companion to the [Hands-on Guide](https://lennon-c.github.io/python-wikitext-parser-guide), consolidating the code covered in the tutorial into a single package for convenient access.

## Installation
The package was created using Python 11, so make sure that you have Python 11 or later. You can install the package from the my GitHub repo: 

```bash 
pip install git+https://github.com/lennon-c/de_wiktio.git
